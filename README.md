# CFD Study of the Magnus Effect

Developed a CFD algorithm modeling the trajectory of a rotating ball subjected to the Magnus effect in three main steps:
- Advection and diffusion step calculation (fractional step method and semi-Lagrangian formalism)
- Added a penalty and a correction step
- Integration of pressure forces to determine the trajectory of a rotating ball
